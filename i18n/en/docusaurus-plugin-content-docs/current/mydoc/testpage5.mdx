# Hello

This is my **first Docusaurus document**!

*this is a test document*

**2025/06/23**




âœ… Simply put: **MDX = Markdown + React components, must follow JSX syntax.**
## Testing: Attempting to deploy git pages with EurekaShadow
You can use `nano <filename>` to edit a file. For example, I'm currently using the command `nano hello.mdx` to edit this content.

After editing, save with `Ctrl + O -> Enter`, then exit with `Ctrl + X`.  
Now attempting to deploy the site again using the EurekaShadow account. (Previous failures might be due to **large audio/video files** causing deployments to take ~180s). Hoping this attempt succeeds.

TIPS: After using `cd` to enter a directory, use `ls` to list files. To edit a file, use `nano` as shown above - you don't need to type the full filename (e.g. type `nano hello` then press Tab for autocomplete).

Testing! Moved test-site to D: drive and deleted C: drive files to verify normal deployment. (20250820)
