I have now deployed my website on Vercel. Since Vercel has already been associated with my current website's GitHub account, when deploying on Vercel,
all you need to do is to commit the new content to the local repository and then `git push` it to the remote. Vercel will automatically recognize the changes in the repository content and automatically deploy it. 
If you previously deployed to `git pages`, you would need to run `yarn deploy`, which would build a `build` folder locally. However, for Vercel deployment, this is not necessary because the build process is carried out remotely.
